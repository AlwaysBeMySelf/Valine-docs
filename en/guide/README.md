# Introduction

Valine was born in August 7, 2017. It's a fast, simple & efficient Leancloud based no back end comment system.

Theoretically, but not limited to static blog. [Hexo](https://hexo.io/), [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), [Typecho](http://typecho.org/) and other blog programs are currently using Valine.

## Features
- Emoji :wink:
- High speed.
- Safe by default.
- No server-side implementation.
- Support for full markdown syntax.
- Simple and lightweight (~15kB gzipped).

## Todo
Valine is still in the development phase. Here are some features that are not currently supported but are already planned:
- Article reading statistics
- Firebase-based comment store

## Donate
If you are enjoying this app, please consider making a donation to keep it alive, I will try my best to dedicate more time or even full time to work on it. ðŸ˜‰
