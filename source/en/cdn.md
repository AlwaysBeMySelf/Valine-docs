Recommended: [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/), which will reflect the latest version as soon as it is published to npm.

## Specific version

```html
<script src="//unpkg.com/valine@1.1.9/dist/Valine.min.js"></script>
```

## Latest version

``` html
<script src="//unpkg.com/valine/dist/Valine.min.js"></script>
```

> Specify **VERSION** for `latest` to force the latest version to be requested each time.
